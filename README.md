App that helps you track and complete your goals

The concept is next: You have your important life-goals. Here they're called diamonds.
You choose your next goal (find your diamond). Set completion time (min 1 hour) and start moving towards it (polishing).
When you complete it, you choose "Get diamond" and the diamond is put in "Earned diamonds" section.
Also there is an "Ideas" section, where you can track different interesting thoughts or short goals during current day.
